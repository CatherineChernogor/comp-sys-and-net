Data science is my pain. 
And if the monster that hits me doesn't die itself, it will soon kill me. 
I can feel it getting closer. What else do you expect from a woman?
 What? Why are you silent? Hey! Hey! Hey! Do you hear? It's me! It's me! 
Can't you see that I love you? That I don't love you? 
Why do I live? I don't know. 
I never knew that. 
So why do I live? I don't know. 
I just go through life, and life goes through me. 
Like this. 
And nothing else.
